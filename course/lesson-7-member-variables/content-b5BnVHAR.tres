On the computer, the position (0, 0) happens to correspond to the top-left of your computer screen. It then makes sense for coordinates to be positive when going towards the bottom-right corner.

This leads to another question: why is position zero the top left of the screen? This is due to computer and TV displays history: they would calculate and display pixels starting from the top left corner and moving towards the bottom right corner."
