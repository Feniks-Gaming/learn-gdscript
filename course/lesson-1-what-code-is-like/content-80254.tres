text = "Along the way, we'll teach you:

- Some of the mindset you need as a developer. Too many programming courses skip that essential part.
- Some foundations of game programming. Knowing that will help you with any game engine.
- How to write real GDScript code.
- Most of the GDScript language's syntax.

As you go through the course, you will have many questions. We will answer them the best we can as we go.

But there is so much to cover that we'll have to take a few shortcuts. We don't want to [i]overwhelm[/i] you with information. We also want to respect the pace at which our brains memorize things.

We broke down the course into bite-size lessons with many short practices. If we shoved too much in each part, you'd learn slower.

If at any time you're left with burning questions, you're more than welcome to join [url=https://discord.gg/87NNb3Z]our Discord community[/url]."
