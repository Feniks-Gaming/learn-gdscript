To do so, you start a line of code with the [code]var[/code] keyword followed by your desired variable name. Like [code]func[/code] stands for [i]function[/i], [code]var[/code] stands for [i]variable[/i].

The following line defines a [code]health[/code] variable pointing to no value. You can think of it as creating a product label you have yet to stick onto something."
