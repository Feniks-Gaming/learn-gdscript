This is because the computer uses spaces to detect the separation between different keywords and identifiers.

Instead of spaces, in GDScript, we use underscores (\"_\"). You saw this already with functions like [code]move_forward()[/code] or [code]move_local_x()[/code].

Identifiers also have to start with a letter or an underscore; You [i]can't[/i] start with a number, but you can use numbers after the first character."
